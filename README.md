I tried to do this website to test my ability on html, css and javascript. I don't know if I wrote a good code but it worked as I wanted, less the skyblue gradient. Anyway, if you can improve this code, feel free to do it. It's simple but it's my first project in html that I really tried to do my best and use everything I know and to know more.
(and slrry for my English)

Bye
